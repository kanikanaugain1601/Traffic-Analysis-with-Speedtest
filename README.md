### This project focuses on vehicle speed detection using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

By leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and OpenCV for video processing, the system tracks multiple vehicles in real-time, calculates their speed by measuring the time taken to cross two fixed lines in a video, and displays the results. This method provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional radar-based systems, with robust performance in different lighting conditions and the ability to handle multiple lanes of traffic simultaneously.
